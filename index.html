                <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Hey there, I'm Anthea! And this is my website. It's a space to experiment with graphic design, HTML and CSS developemnt, and also to display some of my projects. </p>
                <br>
                <p> I am Electronic Engineer, with an interest in firmware design, robotics, and machine learning. My current field of work is in the Data Engineering and Edge AI team, but I would like to broaden my understanding of Computer Science concepts, and how they integrate with embedded systems. </p>
                <br>
                <p> Aside from engineering, I have a growing list of hobbies that keep me busy...</p>
                <br>
                <p> I love gardening, and bringing greenery to indoor spaces with pot plants. I enjoy cooking and baking on the weekends. I am an avid reader, and a Parkrun enthusiast. And on occasion, I enjoy playing Stardew Valley at my cosy desk set-up. </p>

            <h3> Final-year University Project (2024)</h3>
            <br>
            <p>My Final-year project was an Intra-vehicle Coffee Stabiliser and Anti-spill Device. The goal of the system was to prevent coffee spilling in a car when performing under normal driving conditions, such as braking, accelerating, and turning. It comprised of a sensor subsystem (Inertial Measurement Unit), a control subsystem (PID controller), as well as the physical actuation system (3-D printed platform and servo motors).  </p>
